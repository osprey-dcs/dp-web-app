  /*
   * ingestDataStream(): Bidirectional streaming data ingestion.

   * The Ingestion Service performs initial validation on each IngestDataRequest in the stream, and replies immediately
   * with a IngestDataResponse message indicating acknowledgement for a valid request, or rejection of an invalid one.
   * The request is then added to a queue for async ingestion handling.
   *
   * The ingestion handling of each request in the stream is performed asynchronously.  The Ingestion Service writes
   * data from the request to the "buckets" collection in MongoDB, adding one document to the collection for each
   * "column" of data in the request's DataFrame object.
   *
   * A separate MongoDB "requestStatus" collection is used to note the processing status of each request,
   * with a document for each handled request.  The collection is keyed by the providerId and clientRequestId
   * specified in the IngestDataRequest.  This collection can be used by an administrative monitoring process
   * to detect and notify about errors in the ingestion process.
   * TODO: add API for querying requestStatus by providerId and clientRequestId.
   *
   * The method returns a stream of IngestDataResponse messages, one per request.  Each response includes providerId
   * and clientRequestId for use by the client in mapping a response to the corresponding request.  The response
   * message only indicates if validation succeeded or failed.  Because ingestion handling is performed asynchronously,
   * the MongoDB "requestStatus" collection must be used to determine the success or failure of individual requests.
